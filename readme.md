Welcome to the Hylaine Tech screen.

General tips:
* Finish as much as you can, though 100% completion is **not** required. I’d focus on completing the 
	“Crossword Solver” challenge and using it as a scratchpad if necessary for the other problems.
* A great target completion time would be within 4 business days, or the weekend + 2 full business days.
	Most applicants finish after around 5 hours of work - if you need extra time or the screen is taking
	much longer than that please let us know!
* The solution should open in any editor, and is targets .NET Core so should compile and run with the correct
	tooling.
* Most of the questions are self-explanatory with comments inside each one. Some require you to write code, 
	others ask for your comments. Please prepend your comments with your initials.
* Any and all feedback is welcomed/encouraged. If you have questions feel free to ask - this helps us
	improve our prompts if necessary.
* When you return the screen, please do so in an archived named "{Your Name} - Hylaine.zip"
